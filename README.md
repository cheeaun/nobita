A simple script to check in to a (configurable) [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) (Swarm) location when user is within range. It detects user location with [WhereAmI](https://github.com/robmathers/WhereAmI) that uses OSX CoreLocation framework. Optionally run this with `launchd` to automatically check in at specific times ðŸ˜‰

**NOTE: This runs only on macOS.**

Steps
---

1. `yarn` to setup all dependencies and download `whereami`.
2. Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json` and configure:
  - `access_token`: OAuth access token from Foursquare
  - `venue`: ID, coordinates, and radius (metres, optional, default 10) of venue
  - `venues`: Object containing name:venue pair (same structure as `venue`)
3. Schedule run script with `launchd` or [LaunchControl](http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/).
  - (optional) first argument is the venue key to select from `venues` in `config.json`
  - If no argument is supplied it will use `venue`

To get the access token, follow instructions on this page: https://developer.foursquare.com/overview/auth

To get the venue ID and coordinates, inspect the XHR autocomplete API call on https://foursquare.com/
